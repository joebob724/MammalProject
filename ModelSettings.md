## Parameters we want to keep
 * Root constraint as the whole Early/Middle Jurassic (uniform)
 * Constraint the root and the in group
 *
 
 
## First set (Assump one)
 * Peramus outgroup
 * Some clades constrained (as monophyly)
 * Root age contrain + internal topological constrain
 * molecular backbone

This one took 4hours for 1M leading to non-convergence (ESS ~ 5)


## Second set (Assump two)
 * Root age + internal topology + internal node age
 * Nannolestes as outgroup
 	* Two_Peramus (same but with Peramus)
 
 
This one took 7h for 5M leading to non-convergence (ESS ~ 3)


## Third set (Assump Three)
 * Root age + internal topology + internal node age
 * Peramus as outgroup
 * Placentalia set at 93 Mya
 
 
This one took 8h for 5M leading to non-convergence (ESS ~ 3)
